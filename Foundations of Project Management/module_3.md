# Understanding the project life cycle

## Introduction: The project managament life cycle and methodoligies

- Explain and follow the life cycle of a project
- Define and outline a project's phases and each phases's tasks
- Compare different project management methodologies
- Determine which methodology is most effective for a project
- Organiza how a project is staged according to different program management methodologies

## Explorer the phases of the project life cycle

### Project life cycle

Most projects have four phases:
- Initiate the project
- Make a plan
- Execute & complete tasks
- Clost the project

### Initiate the project

In this phase, you need to define project goals and delivaerables, identify the budget and resource you will need, the people involed the project and any other details that can impact the successfull the project.

After that, documentation in one place to showcase the project's value and hopefully get the approval.

Once the project is approved -> next step.

### Make a plan (how you will meet the goals of your project)

- Create a plan
  - A budget
  - A breakdown of task
  - Ways to communicate team roles
  - Responsibilites
  - A schedule
  - Resources
  - What you do in the case your project encounters problems or need to change

### Execute and complete tasks

- Monitor progress and keep your team motivated.
- Remove any obstacles that might come up

### Complete the project

- Celebrate all of their hard work
- Evaluate the project -> plan better for next time
- Share the team's accomplishments with people outside the team

# Phases in action: Initiating and planning

## Initiate the project

- Define project goals: define what you need to complete
  - You need to do some research to come up with the ideas that will help you meet the goals.
- Detemine resources, people, and other project details
  - Include people, equipment, software programs, vendors, physical space or locations and more.
  - Anything you need to complete the project is considered a resource
- Get project approval

## Make a plan

- Create a budget
- Set the schedule
- Establish your team
- Determine roles and responsibilites
- Plan for risk and change: Scheduling delays, budget changes, technology and software requirements, legal issues, quality control, and access to resources are just some of the more common types of risks and changes that a project manager needs to consider
- Establish communication: ensure that every members know which tasks they will own and what to do if they have questions or if they run into the problems, and also communicate with others

# Phases in action: Executing and closing

## Executing and complete tasks

- Manage the progress
- Communicate: meetings, written communications like memos, emails internal chat tools and other working documnets like task reports
- Make adjustments

## Closing the project

- Ensure all tasks have been completed
- Confirm acceptance of the project outcome with the people you are delivering it to: confirm if the project is satisfied with the end result.
- Reflect on lessions learned (retrospective):
  - A retrospective is a chance to note best practices and learn how to manage a project more effectively the next time.
- Communicate results with stakeholders
- Celebrate completing the project
- Formally move on from the project

# Summary of the project phases

## The project life cycle

### Initiate the project

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

- Who are the stakeholders?

- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?

- What is the purpose and mission of the project?

- What are the measurable objectives for the team?

- What is the project trying to improve?

- When does this project need to be completed?

- What skills and resources will the project require?

- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

### Make a plan

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish.

- Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?

- Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

### Execute the project

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action.

- Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks.

- Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks.

- Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.

- Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.

Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

### Close the project

- In this phase, close out the project.

- Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes.

- Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.

- Take time with your team to celebrate your successes!

- Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.

- Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.

- Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

# Comparing project management methodologies and approaches

## Introduction

A project management methodology is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. The method can be linear (with one task completed before the next can begin) or iterative (with some tasks happening at the same time).

# Overview of waterfall and agile approaches


## Waterfall

Waterfall has linear approach.

When would you want to use a Waterfall approach to project management? - When the phases of the project are clearly defined
- When there are tasks to complete before another can begin
- When changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started

## Agile

Built for change and flexibility.
- Able to move quickly and easily
- Willing to change and adapt
- Done in pieces

Agile projects phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum are called Sprints.

Sprints are short chunks of time usually one to four weeks where a team works together to focus on completing specific tasks.

## Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma

With Lean Six Sigma, there are five phases
- Define: similar with initiate phase
  - You will need to define the project goal and talk to stakeholders about expectations for the project
- Measure: measure how the current process is performing
  - Set a plan -> get that data -> measure it
- Analyze
  - Identify the gap and issue
- Improve
  - Present your findings and get ready to start making improvements
- Control
  - Controlling is all about learning from the work you did up front to put new processes and documentation in place

Commonly known as DMAIC.

## Lean and Six Sigma methodologies

### Lean

The main principle in Lean methodology is the removal of waste within an operation. By optimization process steps and eliminating waste, only value is added at each phase of production.

Today, the Lean Manufacturing methodology recognizes eight types of waste within an operation: defects, excess processing, overproduction, waiting, inventory, transportation, motion, and non-utilized talent. In the manufacturing industry, these types of waste are often attributed to issues such as:

- Lack of proper documentation

- Lack of process standards

- Not understanding the customers’ needs

- Lack of effective communication

- Lack of process control

- Inefficient process design

- Failures of management

The 5S method includes these five steps:
- Sort: Remove all items not needed for current production operations and leave only the bare essentials.

- Set in order: Arrange needed items so that they are easy to use. Label items so that anyone can find them or put them away.

- Shine: Keep everything in the correct place. Clean your workspace every day.

- Standardize: Perform the process in the same way every time.

- Sustain: Make a habit of maintaining correct procedures and instill this discipline in your team.

Within the Lean methodology, 5S helps you boost performance.

The final concept of Lean uses a **Kanban** scheduling system to manage production.

### Six Sigma

Six Sigma is a methodology used to reduce variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The term “Six Sigma” originates from statistics and generally means that items or processes should have 99.9996% quality.

The seven key principles of Six Sigma are:

- Always focus on the customer.

- Identify and understand how the work gets done. Understand how work really happens.

- Make your processes flow smoothly.

- Reduce waste and concentrate on value.

- Stop defects by removing variation.

- Involve and collaborate with your team.

- Approach improvement activity in a systematic way.

=> Find aspects of the product or process that are measurable like time, cost or quantity => inspect that measurabitem => reject any products that do not meet the Six Sigma standard => unacceptable products has to be improved upon.
