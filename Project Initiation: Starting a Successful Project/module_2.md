# Determining project goals and deliverables

## Project goals

Project goals represent the desired outcomes and what you aim to achieve, such as improving customer response time by 20%.

Well-defined goals are specific and measurable, providing a clear roadmap for the project.

## Project deliverables

Project deliverables are the products or services that are created for the customer, client, or project sponsor. In other words, a deliverable is what gets produced or presented at the end of a task, event, or process.

Clearly defined deliverables help quantify project impact and ensure accountability among team members.

# How to set SMART goals

## Specific

A specific goal is clear and detailed, leaving no room for interpretation.

Specific goals should answer the following questions:
- What do I want to accomplish?
- Why is this a goal?
- Who is involved?
- Where should the goal be achieved?
- To what degree?

## Measurable

A **measurable** goal is quantifiable, allowing you to track progress and measure success.

You can tell the goal is measurable if you can answer the following questions:
- How much?
- How many?
- How will I know when I've achieved it?

**Metrics** are what you use to measure the success of your goal.

**Benchmarks** are points of reference that help you measure your progress.

## Attainable

Goals should be challenging yet achievable, ensuring they are realistic based on available resources and time.

Taking a complicated goal and breaking it down into smaller, achievable steps can help you determine if it seems reasonable for your team to accomplish.

## Relevant

Goals must align with broader organizational objectives and be worthwhile, considering the effort versus benefits.

## Time-bound

A time-bound goal has a defined deadline, helping you stay focused and motivated.

Time-bound goals should answer the following questions:
- When should I achieve this goal?
- How long will it take to achieve it?
- What are the key milestones along the way?

# Introduction to OKRs

Like the SMART method, OKRs help establish and clarify goals or objectives for an organization, department, project or person. OKRs take SMART goals a step further by combining a goal and more detailed metrics to determine a measurable outcome.

O stands for **Objective** and is a high-level goal that is broad and abstract.

K stands for **Key Result** and is a specific, measurable, and time-bound outcome that is aligned with the objective.

OKR is an acronym for objectives and key results. Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome. Key results define how the project team knows whether or not they have met their objective.

OKR stands for objectives and key results. They combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome.
- Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome.
- Key results define how you will measure the outcome of your objective.

Company-level OKRs are shared across an organization so that everyone can align and focus their efforts to help the company reach its goals. Project-level OKRs help define measurable project goals. They need to align with and support both company and departmental-level OKRs.

# Determining a project's scope

Additional questions for project scope:
- What did this project come from?
- Why is it needed?
- What is the project expected to achieve?
- What does the project sponsor want?
- Who approves the final deliverable?

# Monitoring and maintaining a project's scope

In-scope is tasks that are part of the project and contribute to the project's success.

Out-of-scope is tasks that are not part of the project and do not contribute to the project's success.

Scope creep is when a project's scope is expanded beyond the original plan.

Sources of scope creep:
- External factors
  - Customer requests
  - Environmental factors
  - Changes in technology
- Internal factors
  - Product improvements
  - Processes changes

Scope creep can be avoided by:
  - Make project plan visible to all stakeholders
  - Get clarify on project requirements
  - Set ground rules and expectations
  - Create plan how to deal with scope creep
  - Put your agreement in writing

# Strategies for controlling scope screep

To manage project scope and prevent scope creep, follow these best practices:
- Define project requirements by communicating with stakeholders and documenting their needs.
- Set a clear project schedule with outlined tasks and timelines.
- Identify out-of-scope items and ensure all parties understand the impact of proposed changes.
- Offer alternative solutions and conduct cost-benefit analyses if needed.
- Implement a change control process for reviewing and approving changes.
- Learn to say no to changes that threaten the project's scope, budget, or timeline.
- Document costs for any out-of-scope work.

Clear communication and a shared understanding of responsibilities and timelines are essential to avoid scope creep.

# Managing changes to a project's scope

The concept of the scope is important throughout the project life cycle.

To decide if a scope change is acceptable, project managers usually use the **triple constraint** model.

The triple constraint model is a framework for managing projects that includes the three main constraints:
- Scope
- Time (refer to the project schedule)
- Cost (refer to the project budget)

You can't change one constraint without affecting the other two.

# Lauching and landing a project

## Launching a project

Launching a project is the process of starting a project, delivering the project, and getting the project approved.

## Landing a project

Landing a project is the process of completing a project, measuring the success of your project using the success criteria, and getting the project approved.

## Success criteria

Success criteria are the metrics that will be used to measure the success of a project.

Success criteria are typically defined in the project charter.

# Define success criteria

Success criteria
- Tells you if you have met the project goals
- Specific details of project goals, deliverables, and success metrics
- The standard by which you will measure the success of the project

Determining project success criteria:
- Identify the measurable aspects of the project
- Get clarity from stakeholders on the project requirements and expectations

Customer-related metrics:
- **Adoption criteria** refers how the customer uses and adopts the project deliverables or services without any issues.
- **Engagement criteria** refers how often or meaningful customer interaction and participation is over time.

Defining your success criteria should create greater alignment between the team and give everybody better visibility into how to achieve the project goals.

# Some memo

The difference between a goal and a deliverable is the goal is the desired outcome of the project and the deliverable is a tangible outcome of the project.
