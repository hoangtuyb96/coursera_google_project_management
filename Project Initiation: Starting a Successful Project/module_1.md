# Why is project initiation essential?

Initation begins after a problem or opportunity is identified within a organization.

The initation phase is a crutial time for asking stakeholders questions to help define the project scope, performing research, determine resources and clearly documenting the key components of the project.

If the project is not properly initiated, things can go wrong very quickly.

**Note**: Making the project plan is not part of the initiation phase, that is the planning phase.

## Cost & Benefits Analysis

The process of adding up the expected value of a project - the benefits - and comparing it to the cost of the project.

To determine of benefits of project, we need to ask the following questions:
- What value will the project deliver?
- How much money will the project save?
- How much money will it bring it from existing customers?
- How much time will be saved?
- How will the user experience be improved?

To determine the cost of the project, we need to ask the following questions:
- How much time will it take to complete the project?
- What will be the one-time cost of the project?
- Are there any ongoing costs?
- What about long term costs?

The benefits of a project should be greater than the cost.

# Key components of project initiation

Key components of project initiation are:
- Goals
- Scope
- Deliverables
- Success criteria
- Stakeholders
- Resources

## The project goals

The goals is what the project is trying to achieve.

## The project scope

The scope is what the project will deliver that needs to happen to complete the project.

## The project deliverables

Products and services that you will create for your customers, clients or project sponsors.

Deliverables are submited to help you reach the goals and scope of the project.

## The project success criteria

The standards that you will use to measure the success of the project.

## The project stakeholders

Stakeholders are key to making informed decisions at every stage of the project including the initiation phase.

They are the people who have an interest in the project and will be affected by the project.

## The project resources

It is important to identify the resources that you will need to complete the project.

Resources can be:
- Budget
- People
- Materials

## The project charter

A project charter is a document that outlines the project goals, scope, deliverables, success criteria, stakeholders, resources.

**Note**: Timeline is not part of the project charter. It is part of the planning phase.

A project charter allows you to get organized, set up a framework for what needs to to be done and communicate those details to others.

# Performing a cost & benefits analysis

## The benefits of a cost & benefits analysis

Cost-benefit analysis uses objective data to minimize risks, maximize gains, and reduce bias in decision-making. It enables clear stakeholder communication, keeps projects on track, and helps organizations build strong business cases while ensuring resources are invested in the most profitable or useful initiatives.

## Guide questions for a cost & benefits analysis

You might also consider questions about intangible benefits. These are gains that are not quantifiable, such as:

- Customer satisfaction. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services?

- Employee satisfaction. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover?

- Employee productivity. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?

- Brand perception. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

## Calculating the cost & benefits of a project

The process of calculating costs and benefits is also called a calculating return on investment (ROI).

One common formula for calculating ROI is:

ROI = (Benefits - Costs) / Costs
